# AMSET: *ab initio* scattering and transport

## Introduction

Accurately calculating electronic transport properties from first-principles
is often highly computationally expensive and difficult to perform. AMSET is a
fast and easy-to-use package to model carrier transport in solid-state materials.
A primary aim of AMSET is to be **amenable to high-throughput screenings**.
Features of AMSET include:

- All inputs easily obtainable from first-principles calculations. The
  primary input for AMSET is an *ab initio* uniform band structure.
- Scattering rates approximated based on common materials properties
  such as phonon frequencies and dielectric constants.
- Transport properties calculated by solving the iterative Boltzmann transport
  equation.
- Heavily optimised code that can run on a personal laptop. High-performance
  computing clusters not necessary.

AMSET is built on top of state-of-the-art open-source libraries:
[BoltzTraP2](http://boltztrap.org/) for band structure interpolation,
[numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) and
[scipy](https://scipy.org) to enable high-performance matrix operations, and
[pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org) for handling DFT calculation data.

    Currently, AMSET is best integrated with VASP, however,
    support for additional periodic DFT codes will be added in the future.

### Scattering Mechanisms

The scattering mechanisms currently implemented in AMSET are:

- Acoustic deformation potential scattering
- Ionized impurity scattering
- Polar optical phonon scattering
- Piezoelectric scattering

More information on the formalism for each scattering mechanism is available
in the [scattering section](scattering) of the documentation.
